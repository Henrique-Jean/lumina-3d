## ⚡ The Tech Stack
| Tech | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **React 18** | UI Library |
| **Spline** | 3D Design & Runtime Environment |
| **Web Components** | Native Browser Rendering for 3D |
| **TailwindCSS** | Neo-Futuristic Styling |
| **Vite** | Build Tool |

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Real-time 3D Interaction:** Users can rotate, zoom, and explore the product model.
* **Performance Optimized:** Uses native `<spline-viewer>` for 60FPS rendering without React overhead.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** Background blurs and neon glows to match the 3D aesthetic.
* **Responsive Layout:** Adjusts the 3D viewport for mobile and desktop experiences.

## 🛠️ How to Run
1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Henrique-Jean/lumina-3d.git](https://github.com/Henrique-Jean/lumina-3d.git)
    cd lumina-3d
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the experience:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
* Implementing 3D on the web requires handling heavy assets efficiently.
* Solved library conflicts by utilizing **Web Components** (`<spline-viewer>`) instead of standard React wrappers, ensuring better compatibility and performance.
